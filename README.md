# Recognizance
We are Given 8 Attributes(quantities calculated) of airfoil(i.e. cross sectional shape of wing,blade(propeller,rotot,turbine etc.)) which are calculated through various tests.The units of different attributes are given.You have to predict Pressure level(Sound pressure level in decibels) so as to reduce noise.
